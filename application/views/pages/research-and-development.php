<h1>Research & Development</h1>

<p>
    The Research and Development Department is responsible for creating accessible technologies or technologies to 
    assist individuals with disabilities. R & D leaves room for McGrath Solutions to grow and bring in more revenue, so we 
    can hire more associates (interns) and service more organizations.
</p>

<p>
    Research and development provides the opportunity for challenging internships in the fields of robotics and software development. 
    Most of our research and development projects are focused around engineering and require software, mechanical, and electrical engineers.
