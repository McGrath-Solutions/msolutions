        Jeremiah (or jere) is finished with his formal educationary pursuits.  He is very appreciative of McGrath Solutions for the opportunity to advance his own website maintenance skills but more importantly support the drive and mission of non-profit businesses providing turns to people with disabilities.  He envisions this as catalyst for others to do the same.  Jere is married to his lovely wife of many years and together they continue to grow spiritually.
