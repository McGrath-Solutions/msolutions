<h1>Vocational Rehabilitation</h1>

<p>We do work with State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Programs. If you represent a State VR agency looking for a creative and innovative way to serve your clients, please contact Michael McGrath at <a href="mailto:mmcgrath@mcgrathsolutions.org">mmcgrath@mcgrathsolutions.org</a> 865-288-0912.</p>

<p>Our internships provide your clients with valuable work experience and build confidence in their skills. We mentor and guide your clients grooming them into model employees. We also work with transition aged youth interested in careers in the STEM fields.</p>

<p>In addition to our internships, we also provide job readiness, job placement, and direct service provider trainings.</p>
